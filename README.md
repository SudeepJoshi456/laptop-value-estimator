# LAPTOP VALUE ESTIMATOR

## This project was built after I completed a course on Coursera. I applied whatever I learned during the course into this project. 

### This project extensively contains Data Preprocessing and an another major component of this project was model building.

The dataset for this project was downloaded from Kaggle. The data preprocessing was done using Pandas and Numpy, along with data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, it was fed to our model, and the machine learning was built using Scikit-Learn library.

For model building part, 
As there were multiple features and there was a single label i.e., price, I chose  *Linear Regression* Model.
